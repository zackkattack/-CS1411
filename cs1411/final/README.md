#Tic Tac Toe
    
This  is a python based GUI version of Tic-Tac-Toe. It is a easy accessible version of Tic Tac Toe that is available for everyone to play. 

 In our Tic Tac Toe game we created a simple program to run. Tic Tac Toe.In a board with 9 slots, the player is given the choice to choose  character “X” or  ”O”. Once player chooses the character of their choice, you get to choose what slot you want. If you get 3 characters in a row you win the game, if not the computer wins. After the game is over, it will display who the winner is on text box then. After you click okay on the box, the program will close.
